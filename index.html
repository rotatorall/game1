        <img class="u-image u-image-default u-image-1" src="images/hextechheader.jpg" alt="" data-image-width="1024" data-image-height="573">
        <p class="u-text u-text-2">Piltover, Valoran’s cultural center with a gorgeous steampunk aesthetic, serves as the primary backdrop for Hextech Mayhem. You star as Ziggs, a zany yordle (a spirit that takes the form of a mammal) with a deep love and appreciation for big bombs. Instead of using his explosives to take down other champions in the arena, this time around, Ziggs embarks on a journey to build the one bomb to rule them all while avoiding his strict and rigid nemesis Heimerdinger. 

As Ziggs, you’ll “bomb to the beat,” running over floating icons that change your orientation (e.g., launch you in the air, drop you back down to the ground, etc.) across a horizontal map of Piltover while simultaneously decimating waves of foes and large-scale bosses with fiery explosions. Heimerdinger is the resident party pooper and his armed troopers and weaponized machinations stand between you and your musical escapades. 

It seems as if the challenge of Hextech Mayhem derives from its utilization of sensory overload. You’ll be moving in tandem with the music, but balls of fire emitted after hitting enemies and objects alike with bombs fill the screen and make navigation a disorienting activity. You’ll have to pay attention and try your best to disregard the colorful carnage to stay alive.

        <p class="u-text u-text-2">Pokémon has had a deluge of crossovers and collaborative projects over its long lifetime, and seeing Ed Sheeran make the jump from Game of Thrones (and other media!) over to Pokémon is sure to be interesting. With Pokémon being one of the world's most powerful entertainment brands, extending well outside of the gaming sphere into movies, merch, and much more, this partnership is hardly unusual. But how will it play out, exactly?<br>
        The exact nature of this collaboration is anyone's guess, what do you think the artist has in store for the mobile Pokémon game? Are we going to spin magical Ed Sheeran Pokéstops or gyms? Who knows. Maybe we can click to get the new album while we play with our Bulbasaurs. What do you think the collaboration will look like? Perhaps Sheeran will actually become a canonical Pokémon. I mean, it's not that far off in a world where we have Pokémon that are ya know, keychains. So, what do you think this is going to be? Let us know in the comments!

        <img class="u-image u-image-default u-image-1" src="images/solar_ash_mushrooms_room_jpg.jpg" alt="" data-image-width="1200" data-image-height="675">
        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> The last leaves are falling, but there’s no shortage of indies to serve up, as the upcoming feast has many appetizing courses. The Pathless, an action-packed adventure from the creators of Abzû, the brilliant roguelike Death’s Door, and the short-but-sweet A Short Hike are all coming to new platforms. With additional dishes to try like Moncage and Undungeon, this month’s gaming table is stuffed with goodies.<br>
		If mysterious puzzle cubes sound intriguing to you, you’ll want to check out Moncage when it launches November 16. On the surface, it seems like an easy challenge. You have to rotate a box connecting shapes to progress. Each side of the cube has a different scene and, by figuring out which object from one scene matches up perfectly with another, you’ll solve the puzzle. However, as the scene grows more complex, the answers become harder to find. While the puzzle game has no dialogue, that doesn’t keep it from folding narrative hints into its evolving challenges.
